# Projects

This index turns the "Just Know Stuff" essay into small, self-contained projects you can work through. Each item below links to a dedicated page with objectives, suggested exercises, and next steps.

- [Autodiff & gradients](/projects/autodiff/) — experiments with forward/reverse autodiff, custom gradients, Hutchinson trace estimators, and Jacobian accumulation.
- [Convolutions & Attention](/projects/conv_attention/) — implement convolutional layers, U-Nets, multi-head attention, and toy Transformer blocks.
- [Scientific Computing](/projects/scicomp/) — numerical linear algebra, ODE solvers (Euler, Heun, RK), Monte Carlo and numerical stability exercises.
- [Software Development Practices](/projects/software_dev/) — code quality, testing, packaging, performance (C++/Rust/Triton), and collaboration workflows.
- [Mathematics & Statistics](/projects/math_stats/) — core math topics: measure-theoretic probability, analysis, optimisation, and statistical methods.
- [Community & Reading](/projects/community/) — places to follow and recommended resources: Twitter, Mastodon, HN, /r/machinelearning, recorded talks, blogs.
